		                <p><b>ask#undef</b> is a place for IMSA students to get answers to their most pressing questions about life, academics, and affairs at the academy. Here, students can ask questions about routines at IMSA, homework, tips and tricks, among other things and receive reputable answers from other students pertaining specifically to the IMSA experience. Most importantly though, these questions and their answers are stored on the site for use by future generations of IMSA students.
It uses AskBot as a platform, which is an open-source clone of StackExchange. Stack Exchange is a professional Q&A website where users can ask questions and get clear, well-written answers from experts. It is often used by students and professionals alike to propose questions and solve problems.

                                        <h1>Background</h1>
                                        <p>IMSA students are faced with a lot of questions during the day. With the next year at IMSA close at hand, newly-named seniors, juniors, and, particularly, sophomores will be uncertain about how to handle the challenges, procedures, and opportunities that are sure to arise. Many of these questions occur annually. For instance, new sophomores might wonder how off-campus trips work. Soon-to-be juniors might want advice from upperclassmen on finding a good SIR advisor. Seniors may want help on how to approach their college applications. Therefore, it would be advantageous to have a searchable database of common questions and their answers for the benefit of IMSA students for years to come.
These kinds of questions operations aren’t the only kind of questions that are useful beyond the initial ask. Some other questions whose answers may inspire students with similar problems include
						<ul>
							<li>Guidance on particularly hard homework questions</li>
							<li>Clarification about a particular IMSA event, function, club, or tradition</li>
							<li>Help working out problems in a personal project or SIR</li>
							<li>Advice about how to succeed in a particular aspect at IMSA</li>
							<li>And many more!</li>
						</ul>
ask#undef uses AskBot, a platform designed to catalog these questions and make sure they receive good answers. Upvotes allow questions that are especially popular surface to the top of a list of unanswered questions. Students knowledgeable about how to answer these provide answers; good answers are rewarded with upvotes, increasing the answerer’s reputation. This reputation system in turn unlocks privileges—most important among these are moderation privileges, allowing for self-regulation of the site.
With a wealth of knowledge and hands on experience of life at IMSA held by academy veterans, this is the opportunity to preserve it for posterity. ask#undef is the place to ask questions about IMSA so that good answers can be compiled to help create a more informed student body.

                                        <h1>The Plan</h1>
                                        <p>The codebase for ask#undef is already prepared for deployment. Once the website is online, we will invite a few users to populate and use the website for initial interest tests (beta testing). During this time, website moderators and maintainers will be appointed and trained through hands-on tasks, such as helping to iron out detail work on the website using feedback from the beta testers.
	When the website is ready for general use, we will publicize it through IMSA’s communications channels. We will make posters, emails, and other widespread posts to explain what ask#undef is, the ideas behind it (particularly the philosophy of AskBot and StackExchange: professional solution-oriented discussion), and why it’s worth having. As it enters widespread use, the website moderators and maintainers will keep the website in shape, to written standards that will be compiled at that time.
	As the website continues to operate through generations of IMSA students, steps will be taken to ensure that it is well-kempt and demonstrative of the standards of a good student project. First off, successive moderators and maintainers will train the following year’s team, ensuring that there will always be a knowledgeable team to maintain the website. They will be trained according to standards outlined in a ask#undef manual. This written documentation will be compiled this year, and it will also contain guidelines and information on how to maintain the website. In this way, the website will always adhere to the high expectations and bright vision with which it was created.
