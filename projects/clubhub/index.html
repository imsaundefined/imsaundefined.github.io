		                <p>As informative as it is, Students-l is widely regarded as spammy and annoying. At the same time, it's rather difficult to keep up IMSA Virtual Campus. Indeed, scrolling through an endless torrent of emails every day in addition to having to dedicate time to sort through a facebook page can be exhausting. With similar problems in a host of other channels, the result is a heavily fragmented communications scene on campus--it can be very difficult to get a clear idea of what's going on at IMSA.<br /><br />
Club Hub seeks to fix this by providing a location where you can visually grasp the order of events at IMSA. The idea is that if we use posters as "icons" for each event and arrange them in an intuitive way, it'll be easy to literally see what's happening at the academy. Thus our vision: to make it easy to see What the Next Big Thing at IMSA is.</p>

Club Hub has reached open beta, which means that it is well developed enough to be used regularly by everyone on campus. However, it is still a work in progress, and while functionality will not break unexpectedly, characteristics of the website like features and designs are subject to change. Feedback is important! Please let us know how we're doing through the feedback link at the bottom of the Club Hub site.</li></ul>

                                <h2>The Vision</h2>
                                <p>Club Hub is website that aims to make it easy to find out exactly what's up at IMSA in one swift glance. It seeks to complement the existing forms of communication--especially the mailing list and facebook page--by proving a resource that organizes communications beautifully in one place. In the end, Club Hub will help students answer the question, "What's the Next Big Thing at IMSA?"
The current sub-goals focus on the current minimum viable product provided by Club Hub: the poster wall. These goals are to 1) encourage the use of nice and clean posters as visual cues to the events/ideas/movements/etc. they represent; 2) provide organizational tools to students in order to help them better understand what the latest thing at IMSA is; and 3) streamline club and campus communications by consolidating the information all into one format at one accessible place.<br /><br />
As of late January, 2015, Club Hub has reached v0.3 open beta. Featuring a poster wall that visually organizes information about events with posters, it is making significant progress towards fulfilling its original vision.
After the Club Hub poster wall achieves widespread adoption, it will be time to move on to further future visions. Some ideas being considered at the present include
<ul><li>Individual, easily managed club pages for each club that can be organized as to provide overview information,</li>
<li>A dynamic, customizable calendar of events, and</li>
<li>A poster slide-show feature for presentations and advertisement boards.</li></ul>
These updates are slated for the near future, but only site usage will determine if they can be implemented or not. But if one thing's for sure, it's now easier than ever to know What the Next Big Thing at IMSA is.</p>
